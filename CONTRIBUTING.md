To contribute an implementation of a feature defined by a version of the SPDX specification later than the one supported by the current SPDX Tools release, clone the branch `spec/X.X`, where X.X is the major.minor version of the targeted specification (e.g. "3.0").

Once implemented, submit a pull request with `spec/X.X` branch as the parent branch.
