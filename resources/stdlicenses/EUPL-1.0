European Union Public Licence <br/>
V.1.0 
<p>EUPL (c) the European Community 2007 </p>
<p>This European Union Public Licence (the “EUPL”) applies to the Work or Software (as <br/>
defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other <br/>
than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right <br/>
of the copyright holder of the Work). </p>
<p>The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as defined <br/>
below) has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the </p>
<p>Original Work: <br/>
Licensed under the EUPL V.1.0 <br/>
or has expressed by any other mean his willingness to license under the EUPL. </p>
<p>1. Definitions</p>
<p>In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning: </p>
<p>− The Licence: this Licence. </p>
<p>− The Original Work or the Software: the software distributed and/or communicated by <br/>
the Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable <br/>
Code as the case may be. </p>
<p>− Derivative Works: the works or software that could be created by the Licensee, based <br/>
upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence does not define the <br/>
extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work required in order to <br/>
classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is determined by copyright law <br/>
applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.  </p>
<p>− The Work: the Original Work and/or its Derivative Works. </p>
<p>− The Source Code: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most <br/>
convenient for people to study and modify. </p>
<p>− The Executable Code: any code which has generally been compiled and which is <br/>
meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program. </p>
<p>− The Licensor: the natural or legal person that  distributes and/or communicates the <br/>
Work under the Licence. </p>
<p>− Contributor(s): any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the <br/>
Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work. </p>
<p>− The Licensee or “You”:  any natural or legal person  who makes any usage of the <br/>
Software under the terms of the Licence. − Distribution and/or Communication: any act of selling,  giving, lending, renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, on-line or <br/>
off-line, copies of the Work at the disposal of any other natural or legal person. </p>
<p>2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence</p>
<p>The Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,  royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable <br/>
licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: </p>
<p>− use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, <br/>
− reproduce the Work, <br/>
− modify the Original Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, <br/>
− communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work <br/>
or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, <br/>
− distribute the Work or copies thereof, <br/>
− lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, <br/>
− sub-license rights in the Work or copies thereof. </p>
<p>Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or <br/>
later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. </p>
<p>In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral <br/>
right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights <br/>
here above listed. </p>
<p>The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non exclusive usage rights to any patents <br/>
held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Work <br/>
under this Licence. </p>
<p>3. Communication of the Source Code</p>
<p>The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If <br/>
the Work is provided as Executable Code,  the Licensor provides in addition a machinereadable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the <br/>
Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the <br/>
Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the <br/>
Licensor continues to distribute and/or communicate the Work. </p>
<p>4. Limitations on copyright</p>
<p>Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception <br/>
or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of <br/>
the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto. </p>
<p>5. Obligations of the Licensee</p>
<p>The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations <br/>
imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following: </p>
<p>Attribution right: the Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices <br/>
and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must <br/>
include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she <br/>
distributes and/or communicates. The Licensee  must cause any Derivative Work to carry <br/>
prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification. </p>
<p>Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes and/or  communicates copies of the Original <br/>
Works or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution and/or <br/>
Communication will be done under the terms  of this Licence. The Licensee (becoming <br/>
Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or  conditions on the Work or <br/>
Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence. </p>
<p>Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes and/or Communicates Derivative Works or <br/>
copies thereof based upon both the Original Work and another work licensed under a <br/>
Compatible Licence, this Distribution and/or Communication can be done under the terms of <br/>
this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, “Compatible Licence” refers to the <br/>
licences listed in the appendix attached to  this Licence. Should the  Licensee’s obligations <br/>
under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her  obligations under this Licence, the <br/>
obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.  </p>
<p>Provision of Source Code: When distributing and/or communicating copies of the Work, the <br/>
Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository <br/>
where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to <br/>
distribute and/or communicate the Work. </p>
<p>Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, <br/>
service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use <br/>
in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice. </p>
<p>6. Chain of Authorship</p>
<p>The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is <br/>
owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant <br/>
the Licence. </p>
<p>Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work <br/>
are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to <br/>
grant the Licence. </p>
<p>Each time You, as a Licensee,  receive the Work, the original Licensor and subsequent <br/>
Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this <br/>
Licence. </p>
<p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</p>
<p>The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous contributors. It <br/>
is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or “bugs” inherent to this type of <br/>
software development. </p>
<p>For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an “as is” basis and without <br/>
warranties of any kind concerning the Work,  including without limitation merchantability, <br/>
fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of <br/>
intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence. </p>
<p>This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of <br/>
any rights to the Work. </p>
<p>8. Disclaimer of Liability</p>
<p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the <br/>
Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of <br/>
any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, <br/>
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or <br/>
any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the  possibility of such <br/>
damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such <br/>
laws apply to the Work. </p>
<p>9. Additional agreements</p>
<p>While distributing the Original Work or Derivative Works, You may choose to conclude an <br/>
additional agreement to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance  of support, warranty, <br/>
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. <br/>
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your <br/>
sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if <br/>
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred <br/>
by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such <br/>
warranty or additional liability. </p>
<p>10. Acceptance of the Licence</p>
<p>The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree” placed under <br/>
the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any <br/>
other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon <br/>
indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and  all of its terms and <br/>
conditions.  </p>
<p>Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by <br/>
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, <br/>
the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You <br/>
of the Work or copies thereof.  </p>
<p>11. Information to the public</p>
<p>In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic <br/>
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote <br/>
location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to <br/>
the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the identification and <br/>
address of the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and <br/>
reproduced by the Licensee. </p>
<p>12. Termination of the Licence</p>
<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by <br/>
the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. </p>
<p>Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work <br/>
from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with <br/>
the Licence.  </p>
<p>13. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between <br/>
the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. </p>
<p>If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not <br/>
affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be <br/>
construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. </p>
<p>The European Commission may put into force translations and/or binding new versions of <br/>
this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable. New versions of the Licence will be <br/>
published with a unique version number. The new version of the Licence becomes binding for <br/>
You as soon as You become aware of its publication. </p>
<p>14. Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European <br/>
Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court <br/>
of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing <br/>
the European Community. </p>
<p>Any litigation arising between Parties, other  than the European Commission, and resulting <br/>
from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the <br/>
competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business. </p>
<p>15. Applicable Law</p>
<p>This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor <br/>
resides or has his registered office. </p>
<p>This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: </p>
<p>− a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any <br/>
Licensee; </p>
<p>− the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered <br/>
office inside a European Union country.  </p>

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your <br/>
sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if <br/>
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred <br/>
by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any such <br/>
warranty or additional liability. </p>
<p>10. Acceptance of the Licence</p>
<p>The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon “I agree” placed under <br/>
the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any <br/>
other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon <br/>
indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and  all of its terms and <br/>
conditions.  </p>
<p>Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by <br/>
exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, <br/>
the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution and/or Communication by You <br/>
of the Work or copies thereof.  </p>
<p>11. Information to the public</p>
<p>In case of any Distribution and/or Communication of the Work by means of electronic <br/>
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a remote <br/>
location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to <br/>
the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the identification and <br/>
address of the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and <br/>
reproduced by the Licensee. </p>
<p>12. Termination of the Licence</p>
<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by <br/>
the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. </p>
<p>Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work <br/>
from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with <br/>
the Licence.  </p>
<p>13. Miscellaneous</p>
<p>Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between <br/>
the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. </p>
<p>If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not <br/>
affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be <br/>
construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable. </p>
<p>The European Commission may put into force translations and/or binding new versions of <br/>
this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable. New versions of the Licence will be <br/>
published with a unique version number. The new version of the Licence becomes binding for <br/>
You as soon as You become aware of its publication. </p>
<p>14. Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising between the European <br/>
Commission, as a Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court <br/>
of Justice of the European Communities, as laid down in article 238 of the Treaty establishing <br/>
the European Community. </p>
<p>Any litigation arising between Parties, other  than the European Commission, and resulting <br/>
from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the <br/>
competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business. </p>
<p>15. Applicable Law</p>
<p>This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor <br/>
resides or has his registered office. </p>
<p>This licence shall be governed by the Belgian law if: </p>
<p>− a litigation arises between the European Commission, as a Licensor, and any <br/>
Licensee; </p>
<p>− the Licensor, other than the European Commission, has no residence or registered <br/>
office inside a European Union country.  </p>
