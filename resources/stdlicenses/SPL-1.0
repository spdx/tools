non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property<br/>
claims:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or<br/>
trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify,<br/>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or<br/>
portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a<br/>
Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of<br/>
Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for<br/>
sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions<br/>
thereof).</p>
<p>(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective<br/>
on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under<br/>
the terms of this License.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is<br/>
granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)<br/>
separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused<br/>
by:</p>
<p>i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the<br/>
Original Code with other software or devices.</p>
<p>2.2. Contributor Grant.</p>
<p>Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor<br/>
hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent<br/>
or<br/>
trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,<br/>
display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created<br/>
by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified<br/>
basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a<br/>
Larger Work; and</p>
<p>b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of<br/>
Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in<br/>
combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such<br/>
combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or<br/>
otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or<br/>
portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by<br/>
that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such<br/>
combination).</p>
<p>(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective<br/>
on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered<br/>
Code.</p>
<p>(d) notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is<br/>
granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the<br/>
Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for<br/>
infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor<br/>
Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that<br/>
Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor<br/>
Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by<br/>
Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that<br/>
Contributor.</p>
<p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Application of License.</p>
<p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br/>
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br/>
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br/>
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br/>
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br/>
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br/>
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br/>
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br/>
License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include<br/>
an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br/>
Section 3.5.</p>
<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br/>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br/>
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br/>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br/>
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br/>
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br/>
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br/>
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br/>
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br/>
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br/>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
<p>3.3. Description of Modifications.</p>
<p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br/>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br/>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br/>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br/>
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br/>
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br/>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br/>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.</p>
<p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p>
<p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s<br/>
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br/>
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor<br/>
must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled<br/>
&quot;../LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in<br/>
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If<br/>
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made<br/>
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly<br/>
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available<br/>
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate<br/>
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who<br/>
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p>
<p>If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming<br/>
interface (&quot;API&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses<br/>
which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br/>
also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>
<p>(c) Representations.</p>
<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section<br/>
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications<br/>
are Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has<br/>
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this<br/>
License</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3.5. Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br/>
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br/>
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br/>
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br/>
to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)<br/>
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br/>
Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br/>
for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership<br/>
rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to<br/>
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br/>
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br/>
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br/>
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br/>
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br/>
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br/>
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br/>
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br/>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br/>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br/>
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br/>
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br/>
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br/>
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br/>
collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the<br/>
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br/>
Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br/>
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br/>
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br/>
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s<br/>
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br/>
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br/>
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br/>
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br/>
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br/>
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br/>
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br/>
terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.7. Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other<br/>
code<br/>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br/>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br/>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br/>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br/>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br/>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br/>
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br/>
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br/>
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br/>
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br/>
understand it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br/>
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. Versions of the License.</p>
<p>6.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. (&quot;Sun&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>
of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br/>
distinguishing version number.</p>
<p>6.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of<br/>
the<br/>
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br/>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br/>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one<br/>
other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered<br/>
Code created under this License.</p>
<p>6.3. Derivative Works.</p>
<p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you<br/>
may<br/>
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br/>
governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that<br/>
the phrases &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Sun Public License,&quot; or &quot;SPL&quot;../ or any confusingly<br/>
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your<br/>
license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear<br/>
that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the<br/>
Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<br/>
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A<br/>
shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this<br/>
License.)</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;../AS IS&apos;&apos; BASIS,<br/>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br/>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br/>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br/>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br/>
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br/>
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br/>
COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br/>
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br/>
ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br/>
DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>
<p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br/>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br/>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br/>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br/>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br/>
shall survive.</p>
<p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br/>
claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br/>
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br/>
You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging<br/>
that:</p>
<p>(a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br/>
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br/>
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br/>
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br/>
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br/>
agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br/>
royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br/>
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br/>
the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days<br/>
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br/>
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br/>
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br/>
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br/>
the 60 day notice period specified above.</p>
<p>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s<br/>
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br/>
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br/>
and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br/>
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br/>
Participant.</p>
<p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br/>
alleging that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or<br/>
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br/>
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br/>
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br/>
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br/>
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br/>
license.</p>
<p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,<br/>
all<br/>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br/>
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br/>
prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br/>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br/>
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br/>
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR<br/>
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br/>
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br/>
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br/>
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br/>
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br/>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br/>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br/>
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br/>
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in<br/>
48<br/>
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot;<br/>
and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot;../ as such terms are<br/>
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.<br/>
12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all<br/>
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights<br/>
set forth herein.</p>
<p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br/>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br/>
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br/>
California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br/>
any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br/>
With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br/>
or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br/>
States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br/>
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br/>
District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br/>
California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br/>
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and<br/>
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br/>

<p>(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective<br/>
on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under<br/>
the terms of this License.</p>
<p>(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is<br/>
granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)<br/>

Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by<br/>
Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that<br/>
Contributor.</p>
<p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p>
<p>3.1. Application of License.</p>
<p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br/>
governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br/>
Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br/>
distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br/>
of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br/>
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br/>
distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br/>
version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br/>
License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include<br/>
an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br/>
Section 3.5.</p>
<p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</p>
<p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br/>
made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br/>
either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br/>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br/>
Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br/>
Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br/>
months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br/>
(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br/>
has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br/>
ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br/>
Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
<p>3.3. Description of Modifications.</p>
<p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br/>
file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br/>
the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br/>
the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br/>
Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br/>
Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br/>
Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br/>
origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p>
<p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.</p>
<p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p>
<p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&apos;s<br/>
intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br/>
granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor<br/>
must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled<br/>
&quot;../LEGAL&apos;&apos; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in<br/>
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If<br/>
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made<br/>
available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly<br/>
modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available<br/>
thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate<br/>
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who<br/>
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p>
<p>If Contributor&apos;s Modifications include an application programming<br/>
interface (&quot;API&quot;../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses<br/>
which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br/>
also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>
<p>(c) Representations.</p>
<p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section<br/>
3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&apos;s Modifications<br/>
are Contributor&apos;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has<br/>
sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this<br/>
License</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3.5. Required Notices.</p>
<p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br/>
Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br/>
Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br/>
location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br/>
to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)<br/>
You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br/>
Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br/>
for the Source Code where You describe recipients&apos; rights or ownership<br/>
rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to<br/>
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br/>
obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br/>
may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br/>
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br/>
any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br/>
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br/>
Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br/>
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p>
<p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br/>
requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br/>
and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br/>
the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br/>
including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br/>
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br/>
in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br/>
collateral in which You describe recipients&apos; rights relating to the<br/>
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br/>
Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br/>
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br/>
compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br/>
Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&apos;s<br/>
rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br/>
License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br/>
license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br/>
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br/>
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br/>
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br/>
the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br/>
terms You offer.</p>
<p>3.7. Larger Works.</p>
<p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other<br/>
code<br/>
not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br/>
Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br/>
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br/>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br/>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br/>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br/>
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br/>
be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br/>
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br/>
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br/>
understand it.</p>
<p>5. Application of this License.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br/>
attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p>
<p>6. Versions of the License.</p>
<p>6.1. New Versions.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. (&quot;Sun&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>
of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br/>
distinguishing version number.</p>
<p>6.2. Effect of New Versions.</p>
<p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of<br/>
the<br/>
License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br/>
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br/>
of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one<br/>
other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered<br/>
Code created under this License.</p>
<p>6.3. Derivative Works.</p>
<p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you<br/>
may<br/>
only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br/>
governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that<br/>
the phrases &quot;Sun,&quot; &quot;Sun Public License,&quot; or &quot;SPL&quot;../ or any confusingly<br/>
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your<br/>
license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear<br/>
that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the<br/>
Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<br/>
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A<br/>
shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this<br/>
License.)</p>
<p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>
<p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;../AS IS&apos;&apos; BASIS,<br/>
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br/>
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br/>
DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br/>
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br/>
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br/>
YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br/>
COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br/>
OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br/>
ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br/>
DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION.</p>
<p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br/>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br/>
such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br/>
sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br/>
survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br/>
nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br/>
shall survive.</p>
<p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br/>
claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br/>
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br/>
You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging<br/>
that:</p>
<p>(a) such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br/>
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br/>
Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br/>
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br/>
unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br/>
agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br/>
royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br/>
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br/>
the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days<br/>
of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br/>
mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br/>
is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br/>
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br/>
the 60 day notice period specified above.</p>
<p>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&apos;s<br/>
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br/>
any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br/>
and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br/>
sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br/>
Participant.</p>
<p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br/>
alleging that such Participant&apos;s Contributor Version directly or<br/>
indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br/>
by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br/>
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br/>
granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br/>
into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br/>
license.</p>
<p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,<br/>
all<br/>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br/>
which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br/>
prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br/>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br/>
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br/>
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR<br/>
ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br/>
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br/>
WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br/>
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br/>
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br/>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br/>
RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br/>
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br/>
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br/>
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>
<p>The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in<br/>
48<br/>
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot;<br/>
and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot;../ as such terms are<br/>
used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.<br/>
12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all<br/>
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights<br/>
set forth herein.</p>
<p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br/>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br/>
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br/>
California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br/>
any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br/>
With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br/>
or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br/>
States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br/>
subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br/>
District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br/>
California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br/>
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and<br/>
expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br/>
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br/>
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br/>
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br/>
License.</p>
<p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>
<p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br/>
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br/>
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br/>
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br/>
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br/>
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>
<p>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</p>
<p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br/>
?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial<br/>
Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br/>
Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the<br/>
Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.</p>
<p>Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.</p>
