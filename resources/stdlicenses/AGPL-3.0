﻿                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007<br/>
<br/>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;<br/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
                            Preamble<br/>
<br/>
  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br/>
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure<br/>
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.<br/>
<br/>
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br/>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br/>
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to<br/>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br/>
software for all its users.<br/>
<br/>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br/>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br/>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br/>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights<br/>
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer<br/>
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br/>
and/or modify the software.<br/>
<br/>
  A secondary benefit of defending all users&apos; freedom is that<br/>
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they<br/>
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to<br/>
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and<br/>
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of<br/>
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.<br/>
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and<br/>
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its<br/>
source code to the public.<br/>
<br/>
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to<br/>
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available<br/>
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to<br/>
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the<br/>
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on<br/>
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source<br/>
code of the modified version.<br/>
<br/>
  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and<br/>
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is<br/>
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has<br/>
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under<br/>
this license.<br/>
<br/>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
modification follow.<br/>
<br/>
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
  0. Definitions.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br/>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and<br/>
&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.<br/>
<br/>
  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br/>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br/>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the<br/>
earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.<br/>
<br/>
  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br/>
on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without<br/>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br/>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br/>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br/>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br/>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
<br/>
  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br/>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br/>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
<br/>
  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;<br/>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br/>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br/>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br/>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br/>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br/>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br/>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/>
<br/>
  1. Source Code.<br/>
<br/>
  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work<br/>
for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source<br/>
form of a work.<br/>
<br/>
  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official<br/>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br/>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br/>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br/>
<br/>
  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other<br/>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br/>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br/>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br/>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br/>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br/>
&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component<br/>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br/>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br/>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br/>
<br/>
  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all<br/>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br/>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br/>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work&apos;s<br/>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br/>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br/>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br/>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br/>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br/>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br/>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br/>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br/>
<br/>
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br/>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br/>
Source.<br/>
<br/>
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br/>
same work.<br/>
<br/>
  2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br/>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br/>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br/>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br/>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br/>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br/>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/>
<br/>
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br/>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br/>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br/>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br/>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br/>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br/>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br/>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br/>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br/>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br/>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br/>
makes it unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
  3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/>
<br/>
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br/>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br/>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br/>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br/>
measures.<br/>
<br/>
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br/>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br/>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br/>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br/>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s<br/>
users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br/>
technological measures.<br/>
<br/>
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/>
<br/>
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you<br/>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br/>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br/>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br/>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br/>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br/>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br/>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br/>
<br/>
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br/>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br/>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br/>
    it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
<br/>
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br/>
    released under this License and any conditions added under section<br/>
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br/>
    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br/>
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br/>
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br/>
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br/>
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br/>
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br/>
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
<br/>
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br/>
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br/>
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br/>
    work need not make them do so.<br/>
<br/>
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br/>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br/>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br/>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br/>
&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br/>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users<br/>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br/>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br/>
parts of the aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br/>
<br/>
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br/>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br/>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br/>
in one of these ways:<br/>
<br/>
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br/>
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br/>
    customarily used for software interchange.<br/>
<br/>
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br/>
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br/>
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br/>
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br/>
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br/>
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br/>
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br/>
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br/>
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br/>
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br/>
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br/>
<br/>
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br/>
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br/>
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br/>
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br/>
    with subsection 6b.<br/>
<br/>
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br/>
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br/>
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br/>
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br/>
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br/>
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br/>
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br/>
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br/>
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br/>
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br/>
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br/>
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br/>
<br/>
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br/>
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br/>
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br/>
    charge under subsection 6d.<br/>
<br/>
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br/>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br/>
included in conveying the object code work.<br/>
<br/>
  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any<br/>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br/>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br/>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br/>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br/>
product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a<br/>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br/>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br/>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br/>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br/>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br/>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,<br/>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br/>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br/>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br/>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br/>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br/>
modification has been made.<br/>
<br/>
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br/>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br/>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br/>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br/>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br/>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br/>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br/>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br/>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br/>
been installed in ROM).<br/>
<br/>
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br/>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br/>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br/>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br/>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br/>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br/>
protocols for communication across the network.<br/>
<br/>
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br/>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br/>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br/>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br/>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br/>
<br/>
  7. Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this<br/>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br/>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br/>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br/>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br/>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br/>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br/>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
<br/>
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br/>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br/>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br/>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br/>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br/>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br/>
<br/>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br/>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br/>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br/>
<br/>
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br/>
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br/>
<br/>
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br/>
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br/>
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br/>
<br/>
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br/>
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br/>
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br/>
<br/>
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br/>
    authors of the material; or<br/>
<br/>
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br/>
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br/>
<br/>
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br/>
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br/>
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br/>
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br/>
    those licensors and authors.<br/>
<br/>
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further<br/>
restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br/>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br/>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br/>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br/>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br/>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br/>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br/>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br/>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br/>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br/>
where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
<br/>
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br/>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br/>
the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
<br/>
  8. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br/>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br/>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br/>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br/>
paragraph of section 11).<br/>
<br/>
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br/>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br/>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br/>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br/>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br/>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
<br/>
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br/>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br/>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br/>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br/>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>
your receipt of the notice.<br/>
<br/>
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br/>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br/>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br/>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br/>
material under section 10.<br/>
<br/>
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/>
<br/>
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br/>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br/>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br/>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br/>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br/>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br/>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br/>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br/>
<br/>
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
<br/>
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br/>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br/>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br/>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br/>
<br/>
  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an<br/>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br/>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br/>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br/>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br/>
licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could<br/>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br/>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br/>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
<br/>
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br/>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br/>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br/>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br/>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br/>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br/>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br/>
<br/>
  11. Patents.<br/>
<br/>
  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br/>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br/>
work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims<br/>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br/>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br/>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br/>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br/>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br/>
purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant<br/>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br/>
patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to<br/>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br/>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
<br/>
  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express<br/>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br/>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br/>
sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a<br/>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br/>
patent against the party.<br/>
<br/>
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br/>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br/>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br/>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br/>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br/>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br/>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br/>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br/>
license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have<br/>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br/>
covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work<br/>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br/>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
<br/>
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br/>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br/>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br/>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br/>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br/>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br/>
work and works based on it.<br/>
<br/>
  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within<br/>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br/>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br/>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br/>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br/>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br/>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br/>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br/>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br/>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br/>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br/>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br/>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br/>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
<br/>
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br/>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br/>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br/>
<br/>
  12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.<br/>
<br/>
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br/>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br/>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br/>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br/>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br/>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/>
<br/>
  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the<br/>
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users<br/>
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version<br/>
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding<br/>
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source<br/>
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary<br/>
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source<br/>
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3<br/>
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the<br/>
following paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br/>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br/>
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single<br/>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br/>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br/>
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version<br/>
3 of the GNU General Public License.<br/>
<br/>
  14. Revised Versions of this License.<br/>
<br/>
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br/>
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions<br/>
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>
address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br/>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General<br/>
Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the<br/>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br/>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br/>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br/>
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br/>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br/>
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s<br/>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br/>
to choose that version for the Program.<br/>
<br/>
  Later license versions may give you additional or different<br/>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br/>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br/>
later version.<br/>
<br/>
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/>
<br/>
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br/>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br/>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY<br/>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br/>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br/>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
  16. Limitation of Liability.<br/>
<br/>
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br/>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br/>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br/>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br/>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br/>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br/>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br/>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br/>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br/>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br/>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br/>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
<br/>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br/>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br/>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br/>
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
    &lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br/>
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br/>
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by<br/>
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>
    (at your option) any later version.<br/>
<br/>
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br/>
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br/>
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.<br/>
<br/>
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License<br/>
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br/>
<br/>
  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer<br/>
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to<br/>
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its<br/>
interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that leads users to an archive<br/>
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different<br/>
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the<br/>
specific requirements.<br/>
<br/>
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br/>
if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.<br/>
