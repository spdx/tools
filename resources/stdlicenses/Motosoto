MOTOSOTO OPEN SOURCE LICENSE - Version 0.9.1
<p>This Motosoto Open Source License (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to &quot;Community<br/>
Portal Server&quot; and related software products as well as any updatesor<br/>
maintenance releases of that software (&quot;Motosoto Products&quot;) that are<br/>
distributed by Motosoto.Com B.V. (&quot;Licensor&quot;). Any Motosoto<br/>
Product licensed pursuant to this License is a &quot;Licensed Product.&quot; Licensed<br/>
Product, in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law.<br/>
This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify<br/>
Licensed Product and has been submitted to the Open Software Initiative (OSI)<br/>
for approval.</p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of<br/>
this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal<br/>
effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not<br/>
this Preamble.<br/>
This License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by<br/>
Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked<br/>
as &quot;OSI Certified Open Source Software.&quot;</p>
<p>This License provides that:</p>
<p>1. You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a<br/>
component of an aggregate software distribution containing<br/>
programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is<br/>
required.</p>
<p>2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product,<br/>
including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are<br/>
available for your use. (The terms &quot;Licensed Product,&quot; &quot;Modifications,&quot;<br/>
&quot;Contributors&quot; and &quot;Source Code&quot; are defined in the License.)</p>
<p>3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you<br/>
can create Derivative Works from it. (The term &quot;Derivative<br/>
Works&quot; is defined in the License.)</p>
<p>4. By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License,<br/>
you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed<br/>
Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this<br/>
License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your<br/>
Modifications available to others.</p>
<p>5. You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is<br/>
not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor<br/>
accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn&apos;t<br/>
work properly or causes you any injury or damages.</p>
<p>6. If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may<br/>
charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity<br/>
or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the<br/>
Source Code.</p>
<p>7. If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the<br/>
Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your<br/>
rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically<br/>
terminate.</p>
<p>You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which<br/>
case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative<br/>
Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other<br/>
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of<br/>
your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must<br/>
continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the<br/>
provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your<br/>
Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including<br/>
the files containing Modifications.</p>
<p>New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may<br/>
choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the<br/>
License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right<br/>
to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed<br/>
Product.  This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are<br/>
defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for<br/>
your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.</p>
<p>License Terms</p>
<p>1. Grant of License From Licensor.</p>
<p>Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:</p>
<p>a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br/>
distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including<br/>
Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as<br/>
an executable program. &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred<br/>
form for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including<br/>
all modules contained therein, plus any associated<br/>
interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation<br/>
and installation of an executable program, or a list of<br/>
differential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed<br/>
Product.</p>
<p>b. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch<br/>
copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting<br/>
from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.</p>
<p>c. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled<br/>
by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,<br/>
and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof,<br/>
but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to<br/>
enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or<br/>
otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or<br/>
Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p>2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor.</p>
<p>&quot;Modifications&quot; means any additions to or deletions from the substance or<br/>
structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file<br/>
that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this<br/>
License, the term &quot;Licensed Product&quot; shall include all previous<br/>
Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By<br/>
application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or<br/>
entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed,<br/>
a Modification (a &quot;Contributor&quot;) hereby grants you a world-wide,<br/>
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party<br/>
intellectual property claims, to do the following:</p>
<p>a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br/>
distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or<br/>
portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program,<br/>
either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative<br/>
Works.</p>
<p>b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by<br/>
Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,<br/>
and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but<br/>
solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to<br/>
enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or<br/>
otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or<br/>
Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p>3. Exclusions From License Grant.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is<br/>
granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from<br/>
the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed<br/>
Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the<br/>
trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are<br/>
included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be<br/>
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different<br/>
terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a<br/>
right to license.</p>
<p>4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.</p>
<p>a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the<br/>
terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2.<br/>
Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute<br/>
may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a<br/>
future version of this License released under Section 7. You must<br/>
include a copy of this License with every copy of the<br/>
Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any<br/>
terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed<br/>
Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable<br/>
version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.<br/>
However, you may include an additional document offering the<br/>
additional rights described in Section 4(e).</p>
<p>b. Availability of Source Code. You must make<br/>
available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed<br/>
Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the<br/>
same media as you distribute any executable or other form<br/>
of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in<br/>
the software development community for the electronic<br/>
transfer of data (an &quot;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&quot;). The<br/>
Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or<br/>
Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at<br/>
least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became<br/>
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version<br/>
of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made<br/>
available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code<br/>
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution<br/>
Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
<p>c. Description of Modifications. You must cause any<br/>
Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which<br/>
you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions,<br/>
changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those<br/>
Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or<br/>
deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the<br/>
Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the<br/>
Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any<br/>
Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and<br/>
(ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed<br/>
Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you<br/>
describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product.<br/>
You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in<br/>
the Licensed Product.</p>
<p>d. Intellectual Property Matters.</p>
<p>	i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party&apos;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled<br/>
&quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p>	ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>
<p>	iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>e. Required Notices. You must duplicate this<br/>
License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any<br/>
Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you<br/>
distribute, wherever you describe recipients&apos; rights<br/>
relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice<br/>
contained in Exhibit A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source<br/>
Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you<br/>
created a Modification, you may add your name as a<br/>
Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice<br/>
in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then<br/>
you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant<br/>
directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a<br/>
notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more<br/>
recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on<br/>
your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any<br/>
Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you<br/>
alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every<br/>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such<br/>
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or<br/>
liability terms you offer.</p>
<p>f. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may<br/>
distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of<br/>
your choice that may contain terms different from this License<br/>
provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections<br/>
4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a<br/>
conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation<br/>
and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of<br/>
the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this<br/>
License, including a description of how and where you have<br/>
fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all<br/>
existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you<br/>
make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are<br/>
offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You<br/>
hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor<br/>
for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a<br/>
result of any terms you offer.</p>
<p>g. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may<br/>
create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed<br/>
Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as<br/>
products under any other license you select, with the<br/>
proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for<br/>
those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the<br/>
Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.</p>
<p>5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or<br/>
Regulation.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with<br/>
respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial<br/>
order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of<br/>
this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or<br/>
regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and<br/>
(iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br/>
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d),<br/>
and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to<br/>
the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such<br/>
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary<br/>
skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>6. Application of This License.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
<p>7. Versions of This License.</p>
<p>a. Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location of court.</p>
<p>b. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.</p>
<p>c. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms<br/>
applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.</p>
<p>d. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not<br/>
confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.</p>
<p>8. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
<p>LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT<br/>
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br/>
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED<br/>
PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>9. Termination.</p>
<p>a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach.<br/>
All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.</p>
<p>b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file<br/>
such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable<br/>
reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and<br/>
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice<br/>
Period.</p>
<p>c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a<br/>
patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed<br/>
Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such<br/>
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to<br/>
the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the<br/>
reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under<br/>
Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the<br/>
amount or value of any payment or license.</p>
<p>d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the<br/>
event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license<br/>
agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs)<br/>
that have been validly granted by you or any distributor<br/>
hereunder prior to termination shall survive<br/>
termination.</p>
<p>10. Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY<br/>
DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES,<br/>
BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other<br/>
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of<br/>
your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must<br/>
continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the<br/>
provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your<br/>
Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including<br/>
the files containing Modifications.</p>
<p>New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may<br/>
choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the<br/>
License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right<br/>
to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed<br/>
Product.  This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are<br/>
defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for<br/>
your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.</p>
<p>License Terms</p>
<p>1. Grant of License From Licensor.</p>
<p>Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:</p>
<p>a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br/>
distribute Licensed Product or portions thereof (including<br/>
Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or as<br/>
an executable program. &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred<br/>
form for making modifications to the Licensed Product, including<br/>
all modules contained therein, plus any associated<br/>
interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation<br/>
and installation of an executable program, or a list of<br/>
differential comparisons against the Source Code of the Licensed<br/>
Product.</p>
<p>b. Create Derivative Works (as that term is defined under Dutch<br/>
copyright law) of Licensed Product by adding to or deleting<br/>
from the substance or structure of said Licensed Product.</p>
<p>c. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled<br/>
by Licensor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,<br/>
and/or otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof,<br/>
but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to<br/>
enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or<br/>
otherwise dispose of Licensed Product or portions thereof or<br/>
Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p>2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor.</p>
<p>&quot;Modifications&quot; means any additions to or deletions from the substance or<br/>
structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file<br/>
that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this<br/>
License, the term &quot;Licensed Product&quot; shall include all previous<br/>
Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By<br/>
application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or<br/>
entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed,<br/>
a Modification (a &quot;Contributor&quot;) hereby grants you a world-wide,<br/>
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party<br/>
intellectual property claims, to do the following:</p>
<p>a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and<br/>
distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or<br/>
portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program,<br/>
either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative<br/>
Works.</p>
<p>b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by<br/>
Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made,<br/>
and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but<br/>
solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to<br/>
enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or<br/>
otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or<br/>
Derivative Works thereof.</p>
<p>3. Exclusions From License Grant.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is<br/>
granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from<br/>
the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed<br/>
Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the<br/>
trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are<br/>
included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be<br/>
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different<br/>
terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a<br/>
right to license.</p>
<p>4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.</p>
<p>a. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the<br/>
terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2.<br/>
Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute<br/>
may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a<br/>
future version of this License released under Section 7. You must<br/>
include a copy of this License with every copy of the<br/>
Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any<br/>
terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed<br/>
Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable<br/>
version of this License or the recipients&apos; rights hereunder.<br/>
However, you may include an additional document offering the<br/>
additional rights described in Section 4(e).</p>
<p>b. Availability of Source Code. You must make<br/>
available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed<br/>
Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the<br/>
same media as you distribute any executable or other form<br/>
of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in<br/>
the software development community for the electronic<br/>
transfer of data (an &quot;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&quot;). The<br/>
Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or<br/>
Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at<br/>
least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became<br/>
available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version<br/>
of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made<br/>
available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code<br/>
version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution<br/>
Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p>
<p>c. Description of Modifications. You must cause any<br/>
Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which<br/>
you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions,<br/>
changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those<br/>
Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or<br/>
deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the<br/>
Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the<br/>
Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any<br/>
Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and<br/>
(ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed<br/>
Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you<br/>
describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product.<br/>
You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in<br/>
the Licensed Product.</p>
<p>d. Intellectual Property Matters.</p>
<p>	i. Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party&apos;s intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled<br/>
&quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.</p>
<p>	ii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p>
<p>	iii. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>e. Required Notices. You must duplicate this<br/>
License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any<br/>
Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you<br/>
distribute, wherever you describe recipients&apos; rights<br/>
relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice<br/>
contained in Exhibit A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source<br/>
Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you<br/>
created a Modification, you may add your name as a<br/>
Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice<br/>
in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then<br/>
you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant<br/>
directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a<br/>
notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more<br/>
recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on<br/>
your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any<br/>
Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty,<br/>
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you<br/>
alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every<br/>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such<br/>
Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or<br/>
liability terms you offer.</p>
<p>f. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may<br/>
distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of<br/>
your choice that may contain terms different from this License<br/>
provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections<br/>
4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a<br/>
conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation<br/>
and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of<br/>
the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this<br/>
License, including a description of how and where you have<br/>
fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all<br/>
existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you<br/>
make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are<br/>
offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You<br/>
hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor<br/>
for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a<br/>
result of any terms you offer.</p>
<p>g. Distribution of Derivative Works. You may<br/>
create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed<br/>
Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as<br/>
products under any other license you select, with the<br/>
proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for<br/>
those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the<br/>
Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.</p>
<p>5. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or<br/>
Regulation.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with<br/>
respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial<br/>
order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of<br/>
this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or<br/>
regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and<br/>
(iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br/>
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d),<br/>
and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to<br/>
the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such<br/>
description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary<br/>
skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>6. Application of This License.</p>
<p>This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
<p>7. Versions of This License.</p>
<p>a. Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All changes are related to applicable law and the location of court.</p>
<p>b. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.</p>
<p>c. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the terms<br/>
applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.</p>
<p>d. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not<br/>
confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.</p>
<p>8. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
<p>LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT<br/>
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br/>
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED<br/>
PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>
<p>9. Termination.</p>
<p>a. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach.<br/>
All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.</p>
<p>b. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file<br/>
such an action is referred to herein as &quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable<br/>
reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and<br/>
payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice<br/>
Period.</p>
<p>c. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a<br/>
patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed<br/>
Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such<br/>
claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to<br/>
the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the<br/>
reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under<br/>
Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the<br/>
amount or value of any payment or license.</p>
<p>d. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the<br/>
event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license<br/>
agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs)<br/>
that have been validly granted by you or any distributor<br/>
hereunder prior to termination shall survive<br/>
termination.</p>
<p>10. Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY<br/>
DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES,<br/>
BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY</p></div> -->
