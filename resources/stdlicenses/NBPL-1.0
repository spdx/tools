The Net Boolean Public License
<p>Version 1, 22 August 1998<br/>
Copyright 1998, Net Boolean Incorporated, Redwood City, California, USA<br/>
All Rights Reserved.</p>
<p>Note:<br/>
	This license is derived from the &quot;Artistic License&quot; as distributed<br/>
	with the Perl Programming Language.  Its terms are different from<br/>
	those of the &quot;Artistic License.&quot; </p>
<p>PREAMBLE</p>
<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a<br/>
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some<br/>
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,<br/>
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute<br/>
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make<br/>
reasonable modifications.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>	&quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the<br/>
	Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files<br/>
	created through textual modification.</p>
<p>	&quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been<br/>
	modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes<br/>
	of the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>	&quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or<br/>
	copyrights for the package.</p>
<p>	&quot;You&quot; is you, if you&apos;re thinking about copying or distributing<br/>
	this Package.</p>
<p>	&quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the<br/>
	basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,<br/>
	and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the<br/>
	Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large<br/>
	as a market that must bear the fee.)</p>
<p>	&quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item<br/>
	itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.<br/>
	It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it<br/>
	under the same conditions they received it.</p>
<p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the<br/>
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you<br/>
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</p>
<p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications<br/>
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package<br/>
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</p>
<p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided<br/>
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and<br/>
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the<br/>
following:</p>
<p>    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them<br/>
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or<br/>
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive<br/>
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include<br/>
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.</p>
<p>    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</p>
<p>    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict<br/>
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide<br/>
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly<br/>
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</p>
<p>    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or<br/>
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p>
<p>    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,<br/>
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where<br/>
    to get the Standard Version.</p>
<p>    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of<br/>
    the Package with your modifications.</p>
<p>    c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding<br/>
    Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables<br/>
    non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual<br/>
    pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get<br/>
    the Standard Version.</p>
<p>    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this<br/>
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package.<br/>
You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,<br/>
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly<br/>
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software<br/>
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a<br/>
product of your own.</p>
<p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as<br/>
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall<br/>
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated<br/>
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this<br/>
Package.</p>
<p>7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order<br/>
to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this<br/>
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the<br/>
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do<br/>
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the<br/>
regression tests for the language.</p>
<p>8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote<br/>
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</p>
<p>9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR<br/>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED<br/>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
