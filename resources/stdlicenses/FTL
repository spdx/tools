          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg</p>
<p></p>
<p>Introduction<br/>
============</p>
<p>  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;<br/>
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,<br/>
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the<br/>
  FreeType Project.</p>
<p>  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and<br/>
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license<br/>
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,<br/>
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</p>
<p>  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG<br/>
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion<br/>
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products<br/>
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:</p>
<p>    o We don&apos;t promise that this software works. However, we will be<br/>
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&apos; distribution)</p>
<p>    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or<br/>
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&apos; usage)</p>
<p>    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use<br/>
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge<br/>
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the<br/>
      FreeType code. (`credits&apos;)</p>
<p>  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this<br/>
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.<br/>
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and<br/>
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</p>
<p><br/>
  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a<br/>
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus<br/>
  encourage you to use the following text:</p>
<p>   &quot;&quot;&quot;  <br/>

    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.<br/>

Legal Terms<br/>
===========</p>
<p>0. Definitions<br/>
--------------</p>
<p>  Throughout this license,  the terms `package&apos;, `FreeType Project&apos;,<br/>
  and  `FreeType  archive&apos; refer  to  the  set  of files  originally<br/>
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and<br/>
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project&apos;, be they named as alpha,<br/>
  beta or final release.</p>
<p>  `You&apos; refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where<br/>
  `using&apos; is a generic term including compiling the project&apos;s source<br/>
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program&apos; or `executable&apos;.<br/>
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType<br/>
  engine&apos;.</p>
<p>  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original<br/>
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and<br/>
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its<br/>
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.<br/>
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by<br/>
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p>
<p>  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,<br/>
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as<br/>
  specified below.</p>
<p>1. No Warranty<br/>
--------------</p>
<p>  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS&apos; WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY<br/>
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,<br/>
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR<br/>
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS<br/>
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO<br/>
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</p>
<p>2. Redistribution<br/>
-----------------</p>
<p>  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and<br/>
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,<br/>
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and<br/>
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code<br/>
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to<br/>
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted<br/>
  herein, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file<br/>
      (`FTL.TXT&apos;) unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to<br/>
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying<br/>
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,<br/>
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source<br/>
      files.</p>
<p>    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that<br/>
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the<br/>
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also<br/>
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your<br/>
      documentation, though this isn&apos;t mandatory.</p>
<p>  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on<br/>
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use<br/>
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid<br/>
  to us.</p>
<p>3. Advertising<br/>
--------------</p>
<p>  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use<br/>
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional<br/>
  purposes without specific prior written permission.</p>
<p>  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the<br/>
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation<br/>
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project&apos;,  `FreeType Engine&apos;,<br/>
  `FreeType library&apos;, or `FreeType Distribution&apos;.</p>
<p>  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to<br/>
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted<br/>
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the<br/>
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.<br/>
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType<br/>
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms<br/>
  of this license.</p>
<p>4. Contacts<br/>
-----------</p>
<p>  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:</p>
<p>    o freetype@nongnu.org</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as<br/>
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.<br/>
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you<br/>
      haven&apos;t found anything to help you in the documentation.</p>
<p>    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,<br/>
      specific licenses, porting, etc.</p>
