The Open Group Test Suite License
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which<br/>
a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains<br/>
some semblance of artistic control over the development of the<br/>
package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and<br/>
distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus<br/>
the right to make reasonable modifications.</p>
<p>Testing is essential for proper development and maintenance of<br/>
standards-based products.</p>
<p>For buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced<br/>
integration costs and protection of investments in applications,<br/>
software and people.</p>
<p>For software developers: conformance testing of platforms and<br/>
middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining<br/>
multi-platform application software.</p>
<p>For suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and<br/>
keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is<br/>
highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to<br/>
substantiate that claim.</p>
<p>As such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel<br/>
the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve<br/>
the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test<br/>
package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this<br/>
package to run the original test modes, this license requires that<br/>
the original test modes be preserved.</p>
<p>If you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please<br/>
let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also<br/>
raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for<br/>
example the POSIX committees).</p>
<p>Definitions: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">     &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the<br/>
     Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files<br/>
     created through textual modification. <br/>
     &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been<br/>
     modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes<br/>
     of the Copyright Holder. <br/>
     &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or<br/>
     copyrights for the package. &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&apos;re thinking<br/>
     about copying or distributing this Package. <br/>
     &quot;Reasonable copying fee&quot; is whatever you can justify on the<br/>
     basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people<br/>
     involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it<br/>
     to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community<br/>
     at large as a market that must bear the fee.) <br/>
     &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item<br/>
     itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the<br/>
     item. It also means that recipients of the item may<br/>
     redistribute it under the same conditions they received it. </p>
<p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of<br/>
the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided<br/>
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and<br/>
associated disclaimers.</p>
<p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other<br/>
modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright<br/>
Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered<br/>
the Standard Version.</p>
<p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,<br/>
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file<br/>
stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you<br/>
do at least the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">     rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the<br/>
     names do not conflict with standard executables and<br/>
     testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a<br/>
     separate manual page for each non-standard executable and<br/>
     testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the<br/>
     Standard Version.</p>
<p>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code<br/>
or executable form, provided that you do at least the following: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">     accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with<br/>
     their corresponding Standard Version executables and<br/>
     testcases, giving the non-standard executables and<br/>
     testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the<br/>
     differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with<br/>
     instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</p>
<p>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of<br/>
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this<br/>
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,<br/>
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly<br/>
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)<br/>
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this<br/>
Package as a product of your own.</p>
<p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced<br/>
as output from the programs of this Package do not automatically<br/>
fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever<br/>
generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated<br/>
with this Package.</p>
<p>7.Subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall<br/>
not be considered part of this Package. </p>
<p>8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or<br/>
promote products derived from this software without specific prior<br/>
written permission.</p>
<p>9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR<br/>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED<br/>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
