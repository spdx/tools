THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, AS REPRESENTED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY, IS AN INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF ALL SUBSEQUENT DISTRIBUTIONS OR REDISTRIBUTIONS OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. ANYONE WHO USES, REPRODUCES, DISTRIBUTES, MODIFIES OR REDISTRIBUTES THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, AS DEFINED HEREIN, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS, BY THAT ACTION, ACCEPTING IN FULL THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

D. &quot;Distribution&quot; means conveyance or transfer of the Subject Software, regardless of means, to another.

However, the act of including Subject Software as part of a Larger Work does not in and of itself constitute a Modification.

C. The rights granted under Paragraph B. also apply to the combination of a Contributor&apos;s Modification and the Subject Software if, at the time the Modification is added by the Contributor, the addition of such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the Covered Patents. It does not apply to any other combinations that include a Modification.</p>
<p>D. The rights granted in Paragraphs A. and B. allow the Recipient to sublicense those same rights. Such sublicense must be under the same terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

If Recipient distributes or redistributes the Subject Software in any form other than source code, Recipient must also make the source code freely available, and must provide with each copy of the Subject Software information on how to obtain the source code in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br/>
B. Each Recipient must ensure that the following copyright notice appears prominently in the Subject Software:</p>
<p>[Government Agency will insert the applicable copyright notice in each agreement accompanying the initial distribution of original software and remove this bracketed language.]</p>
<p>[The following copyright notice will be used if created by a contractor pursuant to Government Agency contract and rights obtained from creator by assignment.

<p>[The following copyright notice will be used if created by civil servants only. Government Agency will insert the year and its Agency designation and remove the bracketed language.] Copyright � {YEAR} United States Government as represented by ____ ____. No copyright is claimed in the United States under Title 17, U.S.Code. All Other Rights Reserved.</p>
<p>C. Each Contributor must characterize its alteration of the Subject Software as a Modification and must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not thereafter be revoked.</p>
<p>D. A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice has been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express permission of the Contributor who added the notice.</p>
<p>E.

<p>F. In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government Agency by visiting the following website: ______. Recipient&apos;s name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site provided above how to access the Modification.</p>

Recipient&apos;s name and personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the Modification.</p>
<p>G. Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be Contributor&apos;s original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this Agreement.</p>
<p>H. A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.</p>
<p>I. A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.</p>
<p>J. Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.

A.

THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT, IN ANY MANNER, CONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT BY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT OF ANY RESULTS, RESULTING DESIGNS, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE.
