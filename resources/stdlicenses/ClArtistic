The Clarified Artistic License
<p>Preamble</p>
<p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a<br/>
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some<br/>
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,<br/>
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute<br/>
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make<br/>
reasonable modifications.</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p> &quot;Package&quot; refers to the collection of files distributed by the<br/>
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files<br/>
 created through textual modification.</p>
<p> &quot;Standard Version&quot; refers to such a Package if it has not been<br/>
 modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes<br/>
 of the Copyright Holder as specified below.</p>
<p> &quot;Copyright Holder&quot; is whoever is named in the copyright or<br/>
 copyrights for the package.</p>
<p> &quot;You&quot; is you, if you&apos;re thinking about copying or distributing<br/>
 this Package.</p>
<p> &quot;Distribution fee&quot; is a fee you charge for providing a copy<br/>
 of this Package to another party.</p>
<p> &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the right to<br/>
 use the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the<br/>
 item.  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute<br/>
 it under the same conditions they received it.</p>
<p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the<br/>
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you<br/>
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</p>
<p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications<br/>
derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from<br/>
the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be<br/>
considered the Standard Version.</p>
<p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided<br/>
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and<br/>
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the<br/>
following:</p>
<p>    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them<br/>
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an<br/>
    equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network<br/>
    archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the<br/>
    Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version<br/>
    of the Package.</p>
<p>    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</p>
<p>    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict<br/>
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide<br/>
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly<br/>
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</p>
<p>    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>    e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package<br/>
    permission to make your modifications Freely Available<br/>
    in some specific way.</p>
<p><br/>
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or<br/>
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p>
<p>    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,<br/>
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where<br/>
    to get the Standard Version.</p>
<p>    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of<br/>
    the Package with your modifications.</p>
<p>    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly<br/>
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together<br/>
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</p>
<p>    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p>
<p>    e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your<br/>
    modifications, by mail order.</p>
<p>5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package.<br/>
If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose<br/>
for that support.  You may not charge a license fee for the right to use<br/>
this Package itself.  You may distribute this Package in aggregate with<br/>
other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a<br/>
larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution,<br/>
and charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution,<br/>
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.<br/>
If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package&apos;s<br/>
interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be<br/>
construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete<br/>
Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.</p>
<p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as<br/>
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall<br/>
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated<br/>
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this<br/>
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this<br/>
Package via the so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a<br/>
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall<br/>
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it<br/>
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do<br/>
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this<br/>
Package.</p>
<p>7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other<br/>
languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to<br/>
emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this<br/>
Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the<br/>
equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do<br/>
not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the<br/>
regression tests for the language.</p>
<p>8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial<br/>
distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package<br/>
is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package&apos;s<br/>
interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.<br/>
Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.</p>
<p>9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote<br/>
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</p>
<p>10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR<br/>
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED<br/>
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>
